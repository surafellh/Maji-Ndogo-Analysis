# Part 4 â€“ From Analysis to Action

## ðŸ—‚ Analysis Workflow  
The notebook for Part 4 is divided into 4 sections, moving from analysis to implementation:  

### 1. Joining Pieces Together  
Combined tables across visits, locations, water sources, and pollution records to assemble a complete picture of water access and quality in Maji Ndogo.  

### 2. The Last Analysis  
Built pivot-style tables to break down access per province and town. Highlighted the towns with the highest percentages of broken taps and prioritized repair targets.  

### 3. Summary Report  
Consolidated all findings into actionable insights:  
- Most water sources are rural.  
- 43% of citizens rely on shared taps, often 2,000 people per tap.  
- 31% have taps at home, but 45% are broken in towns like Amina, rural Amanzi, Akatsi, and Hawassa.  
- 18% rely on wells, with only 28% clean (mainly Hawassa, Kilimani, Akatsi).  
- Average queue times exceed 120 minutes, especially on Saturdays, mornings, and evenings.  

### 4. A Practical Plan  
Moved from insight to action by creating a **Project Progress table**, defining clear next steps:  
- Prioritize shared taps in towns like **Bello, Abidjan, and Zuri** to reduce queues below 30 min.  
- Purify polluted wells with **RO and UV filters**, while investigating long-term pollution causes.  
- Restore broken infrastructure in towns like **Amina, Lusaka, Zuri, Djenne, and rural Amanzi** for maximum impact.  
- Provide short-term relief by dispatching **water trucks to river-dependent areas**, starting with Sokoto.

## âœ… Key Success  
This final stage marks the **transition from data analysis to implementation**.  
The insights guided a **targeted, resource-efficient plan** for immediate relief and sustainable improvement.  

By aligning engineering fixes with data-driven priorities, the Maji Ndogo project closes with a **clear roadmap for safer, more reliable water access**.
