# Maji Ndogo Data Exploration & Cleaning

This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and focuses on exploring and cleaning water services data for the fictional region of **Maji Ndogo**.  
The aim is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to understand datasets, identify quality issues, and prepare data for deeper analysis.
