# Part 1 â€“ Data Exploration & Cleaning

## ðŸ—‚ Analysis Workflow
The notebook for Part 1 is divided into **5 sections**:

1. **Getting to Know the Data**  
   - Listed all tables in the database.  
   - Previewed each table to understand fields and data types.

2. **Diving into Water Sources**  
   - Identified unique water source types.  
   - Counted how many of each type exist in the dataset.

3. **Unpacking Visits to Water Sources**  
   - Investigated locations where people spend unusually long times fetching water (~8 hours).  
   - Linked visits to their corresponding water source types.

4. **Assessing the Quality of Water Sources**  
   - Found sources with high visit counts and perfect quality scores.

5. **Investigating Pollution Sources**  
   - Discovered inconsistencies in pollution records.  
   - Corrected mislabelled results and standardized descriptions.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- **Long Wait Times** â€“ Shared taps were the only water source type with extremely long wait times (~8 hours).  
- **Data Quality Issues** â€“ Several pollution entries were incorrectly labelled as "Clean" despite biological contamination.  
- **Importance of Standardization** â€“ Cleaning and standardizing text fields is crucial for reliable reporting and filtering.
